## How the Game Works

**Beat the Market AI** is a 60-second decision-making simulation where players act as traders in a dynamic market environment. The objective is to maximize trading profit within the time limit by making sequential decisions: **Buy**, **Hold**, or **Sell**.

Unlike traditional simulations or random market games, this one features an AI that actively watches, learns from, and reacts to the player's behavior. The game is designed to simulate how intelligent systems or financial markets adapt to exploit predictable strategies.

### Gameplay Flow

Each turn (up to 60 total), the following steps occur:

1. The player selects one action: Buy, Hold, or Sell.
2. The AI observes the player’s behavior by storing recent moves.
3. The **RNN module** (Recurrent Neural Network) processes the last few actions and predicts the player's likely next move.
4. The **GAN-inspired signal generator** then creates a market signal designed to manipulate the player based on that prediction:
   - If the AI thinks the player will Buy, it may simulate a bullish signal (e.g., "fake breakout") to encourage the action — and then reverse the price.
   - If the AI expects a Sell, it might simulate a reversal or false trend to exploit it.
5. The **Market Engine** adjusts the price accordingly, simulating the effect of the signal.
6. Profit or loss is calculated based on the action and resulting price movement.
7. The AI updates its understanding of the player’s behavior and refines its deception strategy on the next move.

This loop repeats until the 60-second session ends.

### Adaptive AI Architecture

The game’s AI behavior is built on three core components:

- **MarketRNN** – Tracks the player’s most recent actions and identifies behavior patterns using a short memory window (e.g., last 5 moves). It predicts what the player is most likely to do next.

- **MarketGAN** – Generates deceptive market signals (e.g., fake breakouts, trend traps, reversals) based on the predicted next action, with the goal of manipulating player expectations.

- **MarketEngine** – Simulates the outcome by adjusting prices based on the signal and the player’s action. It also calculates profit or loss and feeds that back into the AI's learning loop.

This modular architecture simulates an adversarial relationship between trader and market, mirroring how real financial systems exploit observable behavioral patterns.

## Learning Objectives and Real-World Parallel

This simulation is designed to highlight several core concepts in finance, behavioral economics, and artificial intelligence:

- **Behavioral Finance** – The player experiences how habits, emotional reactions, or predictable patterns can be exploited by an intelligent market opponent.

- **Reinforcement and Adversarial Learning** – The AI responds to real-time behavior, simulating how algorithmic systems adjust to human trading strategies.

- **Strategic Adaptation** – Success requires constant re-evaluation of strategy, as repetition leads to exploitation by the AI.

- **AI Transparency and Deception** – Through post-game feedback, players can reflect on how their strategies were detected and manipulated.

## Why It Matters

This simulation reflects real-world trading environments where:

- Human traders face algorithmic adversaries.
- Markets adapt to visible strategies.
- Success depends on adaptability, awareness, and behavioral control.

By playing **Beat the Market AI**, users gain hands-on insight into the intersection of pattern recognition, algorithmic deception, and strategic decision-making in time-sensitive, adversarial settings.
